1> If user sends a new document
    - store new pdf text in the postgresql
    - create new vector and store it in pinecone
    - save the query and response in postgresql
    ! Optional: 
        - If there is a similar file it won't do this [increases one step]
        - User will have the option to create a new vector to get better output 
            - if the progrmam thinks it is not requierd to store the vector it will delete it [Increases two steps]
